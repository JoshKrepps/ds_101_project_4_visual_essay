    "\n",
    "We have spent the last several weeks trying to reproduce the work of Ryan Heuser in [\"The Emotions of London\"](https://litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet13.pdf). Rather than London, we have scraped JMU's Reddit feed to establish the emotions of JMU by first geoparsing the data for locations, cleaning those locations, and then attaching emotions to them. Our ultimate goal was to get a better sense of how JMU students think of the place where they live and study. In particular, we are interested in what the world looks like from the perspective of a JMU students who post to Reddit. Using our data we can start to answer such questions as: \n",
    "\n",
    " - What places are often talked about? \n",
    " - How are they talked about? \n",
    " - What might this tell us about how JMU works as an imagined community?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this visual essay, you are going create a fuller picture of the world as perceived through JMU students by contrasting it with another school in Virginia. Undoubtedly, dorms, food, parking are the concerns of every college students, but in looking at contrasting data sets we can try to figure out what makes the JMU community unique compared to other schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a self-contained visual essay. Your task is to complete it as a group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each section has its own set of instructions and tasks that fall into the following categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **📊 Action Items** = Data exploration and technical tasks\n",
    "- **✍️ Writing Tasks** = Analysis and interpretation assignments  \n",
    "- **🔧 Technical Steps** = Code implementation instructions\n",
    "- **💡 Examples** = Sample content and guidance\n",
    "- **⚠️ Important** = Critical requirements and warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part of the essay draws on a previous skill we have learned, and while you can give ownership of each part to a different team member, it is best to walk through the entire essay with your team twice. First, at the beginning to get a sense of the data and your potential hypothesis, and second, as a final run through to make sure all the parts are coherent. Once you have completed all the sections, delete all of the instructions and leave only your writing, the code, and the visualizations.\n",

The default is `None`, but adding a list of places i.e. (`place_type_filter=[\"University\", \"Building\"]`) only shows those places. In the sample below, only \"States\", \"City\", and \"Country\" places will show up. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Customization Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important:** Make sure that `minimum_count` and `place_type_filter` for `create_locations_counts` are the same for both maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Customization:**\n",
    "- Tweak the center and zoom of your map to highlight an important contrast\n",
    "- Set the `color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly` to something of your choice\n",

    "## Part 5: Sentiment Analysis Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you are going to compare the sentiments by location for each institution. You are going to do so by first customizing the `create_location_sentiment()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Function Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes the same parameters as the `create_location_counts()` function above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`minimum_count=`** - Sets the minimum number of times a location has to appear before it appears on the map. Setting this to the default `2` means that if a location appears once it will not register\n",
    " - **`place_type_filter=`** - This uses the `place_type` column to filter out only the types of places you want. The default is `None`, but adding a list of places i.e. (`place_type_filter=[\"University\", \"Building\"]`) only shows those places. \n",
    "   - **💡 Tip:** You might consider showing only one type of place if it helps make your argument. For example, if you are investigating school spirit, it makes the most sense to look at Universities and buildings.\n",
    " - **⚠️ NOTE:** `place_type_filter` only works if you tagged places properly in the cleanup process. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 Example Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "create_location_sentiment(\n",
    "    df_jmu,\n",
    "    minimum_count=2,\n",
    "    place_type_filter=None  # Include all place types\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Customization Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Optimization:**\n",
    "- Tweak the center and zoom of your map to highlight an important contrast\n",
    "- Experiment with different divergent color scales to optimize the visuals\n",
    "  - **Change:** `RdYlGN` in `color_continuous_scale=\"RdYlGn\"` to something of your choice\n",
    "  - **Color Reference:** https://plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/#builtin-diverging-color-scales\n",
    "- Experiment with different map templates to optimize visuals:\n",
    "  - **Change:** `carto-positron` in `map_style=\"carto-positron\"`\n",
    "  - **Options include:** 'basic', 'carto-darkmatter', 'carto-darkmatter-nolabels', 'carto-positron', 'carto-positron-nolabels', 'carto-voyager', 'carto-voyager-nolabels', 'dark', 'light', 'open-street-map', 'outdoors', 'satellite', 'satellite-streets', 'streets', 'white-bg'\n",
